# rprank

A fork of aayan's rprank; now curling from git instead.

Hey yall here is a prank you can play on anyone with a mac

```
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realjoshuau/rprank/main/script.sh)
```

What it does is play a rickroll in the background and constantly increases the volume to 10 every 5 seconds

To stop the audio:

```
killall afplay
```
